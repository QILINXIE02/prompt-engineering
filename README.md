AI assignment 201

## My prompt to the Bard AI:
I want you to act as an astronomist. You will describe any non-fictional phenomenon in the sky relevant to the interests of society in 2023 and explain what it is.  Start by coming up with interesting facts of that phenomenon and convince audience of all ages why they should care about it. When it comes to innovation, think of an app that can draw people's attention to that topics and convince a wealthy investor to invest in that app. You, the astronomist, then comes to a annual science conference to announce that new application and its benefits to society. 

## Their response:
Astronomically Interesting Phenomenon for 2023

Solar Eclipse

A solar eclipse is a rare and awe-inspiring sight that occurs when the Moon passes directly in front of the Sun, casting a shadow on Earth. Solar eclipses can be either partial, total, or annular. In a partial solar eclipse, only a portion of the Sun is obscured by the Moon. In a total solar eclipse, the entire Sun is obscured by the Moon, and the sky darkens for a few minutes. In an annular solar eclipse, the Moon passes directly in front of the Sun, but it is not large enough to completely obscure it, leaving a ring of sunlight visible around the Moon.

Why Should You Care About Solar Eclipses?

Solar eclipses are important for a number of reasons. First, they provide us with a unique opportunity to study the Sun. During a solar eclipse, we can observe the Sun's corona, which is the outermost layer of the Sun's atmosphere. The corona is normally too faint to see, but during a solar eclipse, it becomes visible because the Moon blocks out the Sun's bright disk.

Second, solar eclipses are a reminder of the interconnectedness of the universe. The Sun, Moon, and Earth are all part of the same solar system, and their orbits are precisely synchronized. This allows us to predict solar eclipses hundreds of years in advance.

Finally, solar eclipses are simply beautiful. They are a reminder of the power and wonder of the natural world.

Solar Eclipse App

I propose an app that would allow people to experience solar eclipses in a new and exciting way. The app would use augmented reality to overlay digital information onto the real world. This would allow users to see the path of the eclipse, as well as the different phases of the eclipse, in real time. The app would also provide users with information about the science of solar eclipses.

I believe that this app would be a valuable educational tool for people of all ages. It would also be a fun and engaging way for people to experience solar eclipses.

Pitch to a Wealthy Investor

I believe that this app has the potential to be a commercial success. There is a large and growing interest in astronomy, and people are always looking for new and innovative ways to experience the wonders of the universe. This app would fill a niche in the market and provide users with a unique and valuable experience.

I am confident that this app would be a profitable investment. I have a team of experienced developers who are ready to start working on the app immediately. We have also developed a detailed marketing plan that will ensure that the app reaches a wide audience.

Announcement at a Science Conference

I am pleased to announce the development of a new app that will allow people to experience solar eclipses in a new and exciting way. The app uses augmented reality to overlay digital information onto the real world, allowing users to see the path of the eclipse, as well as the different phases of the eclipse, in real time. The app also provides users with information about the science of solar eclipses.

I believe that this app has the potential to be a valuable educational tool for people of all ages. It will also be a fun and engaging way for people to experience solar eclipses.

I am confident that this app will have a positive impact on society. It will help to promote interest in astronomy and science, and it will also help people to better understand the universe around them.

I am currently seeking funding to complete the development of the app. I am confident that this is a worthwhile investment, and I encourage you to consider supporting this project.
